## Dog Vision Project

This project uses the mobilenet_v2_130_224 object detection model and trains on 10000 images from the Kaggle Dog Breed competition dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data?select=train

The model was surprisingly accurate in predicting my rescue dog's breeds!
