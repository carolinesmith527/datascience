## Dog Vision Project

This project uses the mobilenet_v2_130_224 object detection model to predict the breed of dog from an image.

The model was surprisingly accurate in predicting both of my rescue dogs' breeds!

This project was a part of the Zero to Mastery Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp on Udemy

### Data

The pretrained model was fitted to 10000 images from the Kaggle Dog Breed competition dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data?select=train
