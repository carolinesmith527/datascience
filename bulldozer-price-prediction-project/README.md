## Bluebook for Bulldozers

This project trains a Random Forest Regression model to predict the price of bulldozers based on a time-series dataset.

The model is then evaluated using the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

This project was a part of the Zero to Mastery Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp on Udemy
